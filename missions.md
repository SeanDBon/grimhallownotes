## Investigate Stehlenwald after Valera Valethorn contact went missing
The party has been asked to find Valera Valethorn missing contact and continue his search into Stehlenwald.
* As we look around the disheveled city, we start seeing marking of a cult that thinks the Weeping Pox is a good thing.
* It appears the cult is intentionally infecting the entire city with Weeping Pox.
* We fight the cultists infecting the city. Including a summoned coral gazer.
* We went into the sewers afterwards since that is where the people seem to have gone after there "baptism".
* In the sewers we found a colony of rat people being lead by a huge rat monster which caused disease.

## Investigate the Weeping Pox
The party has been asked by Valera Valethorn to investigate the Weeping Pox.
* Possibly caused by the rat monster.
* Possibly spread by the group of cultists we met in Stehlenwald.
* Doesn't seem to spread in the blood.
* A person in a coma didn't seem to get worse.

## Meet up with Doctor Mordecai
Farma was asking to talk with a CDC doctor and Valera pointed us in the direction of one.
* We find him in Sleepy Vale, a zesty man.
* It seems people in this town have a memory issue. Maybe a curse.

## Investigate Valera's sister
Valera's sister was sending some wierd letters about falling in love with a boy and running away. This is strange
because her heart was already taken, and she can't imagine it being swayed.
* The Doctor seems to have completely forgotten about her.
* We fought a monster and afterwards the town folk and the doctor get their memory back.
