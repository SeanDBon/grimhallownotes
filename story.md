# Grim Hollow Main Story
> The story following the main party session by session

---

## Session One
The party meets up at a tavern with a fireplace running. While at the bar we meet up with Valera.
She gives the party two missions, one to find her missing contact, and one to investigate the Weeping pox. 
When the party was done talking with Valera they head to bed and have a vivid dream of a beautiful lady.
The lady is reading tarot cards about the past and the future. At the end of the dream she transforms in a
hideous old lady. </br>

The next day the party heads to Stehlenwald to look for Valera's missing contact. As we enter the city we see wrote 
on the wall like graffiti.
> Wallow in the filth, all yee who would be absolved

That was written on the wall with human puss. As we head towards the center of the city, the water channels are 
combining, we see a large statue of a man where the water is heading. We are seeing more and more graffiti, 
even in different languages, as we head towards the center. We see another type of graffiti of a grazer. 
It says bellow it
> Praise be the Grazer

Horus recognizes some graffiti as messaging from a cult. The cult thinks disease is a good thing and filters the chosen.
The closer to the center we get there a large amounts of body's strewn around the streets. Now at the center of the town
we see a line of people that live in the town. Some look angry about being here, some have sad eyes slowly moving up the
line. We watch as the first person in line walk up to statue and grabbed, sometimes fighting, and then gets dunked into
the water 3 times. After we watch for a bit we decide this is not okay, and we have to intervene. We all take a long
shot at the cultist leader and then combat begins. We kill off the cultist mages and only have the big armored man left.
With all the cultists in the water around the statue, we see these tentacles rise up from out of the water. The 
tentacles all have beaks on the end. It is the **Grazer**! Things get a bit dim for the party but M.I.A. and Horus 
manage to take down the Grazer, while the rest of the party delt with the big man. Inside the gladiator they find a 
blight crystal. The grazer suddenly starts rapidly degrading.

We see a man beckoning at us from a window to the north. M.I.A. starts righting stuff down about the encounter before
heading over to the man.

## Session One Continued
As we approach the man he asks us if we are with Valera and lets us know he is Virim. He tells us about a huge event,
larger than the black carnival and other important events. It was a massive celebration he tells us. Then, the next day
it was a horrific site as people are screaming and wailing and bodies becoming diseased. Afterwards the cultists showed
up and started infecting more people. After a long rest we follow Virim to a man whole cover that he mentioned he saw
the people that were being infected heading into. As we head down the sewer river we see a couple intakes that seem to
be blocked off. We enter a large round room, the ceiling partially caved. Where the ceiling caved in there are few
coffins. On two sides of the room there are pipes, one of them has **RATS**. We fill up the two tunnels and then find
some trinkets in the coffins. As we make it further through the sewers we are ganked by the rats. M.I.A. hits a crazy
30x collateral. We get overrun as the rats seem endless, so we make a break for it. We get blocked by two larger boss
rats. As we prepare for death we get saved by a hooded man with gun hands(maybe). We make a jump for a chain the man
climbed. The party talks to him for a while, he explains how a beast killed his rat king and is now producing toxic
sludge. The sludge is causing the Weeping Pox, and he asks for our help to kill him. _**The fight was hard.**_</br>
We see a piece of paper, in another room after the fight. When touched we see a black card, we got a vision. It gave
a pentagram on Bestiarius pointer finger.

## Session Two
After the encounter Vitir asks us to help unblock the sewers, he believes the water is no longer tainted now that the
big guy was dead. The party, in bad shape, decide to go recoup first and takes a long rest. Vitir then pulls out an orb,
and holds it in front of him. He pulls his hand away but the orb stays floating. He then claps and a large explosion is
heard. It seems to have unblocked the passages and with a rush, the sewage starts coming out again. We ask him for some
of his orbs and how to make them. We then ask about the disease and the weeping pox. M.I.A. does some pillaging. After
we head back to Valera to tell her what we found out. We all get paid 250 gold for our troubles. She then tells us our
next mission. She tells us about an expert in medicine that Farma asked about, and then asks if there is anything
strange about some letters her sister sent. We do some shopping and then head out to Sleepy Vale. After a day and half
of travel we get to a small mountain. As we climb the weather turns cold and snowy, odd for this time of year.
We decide to hunker up until it passes. As we get camp setup we hear footsteps approaching. Three strong gladiator
looking dudes approach us. They request the black card that Bestiarius took from the sewers quite forcefully.
The biggest guy suggests a duel with Bestiarius, which he accepts. After a bit of back and forth the big guy goes wacko.
He nearly splits Bestiarius in half. As he is about to pass out we all have a vision of him sitting on a throne above us.
He comes back healed and then the fight really breaks out. It was hard fought, then they seemed to disappear as we are
starting to win.

## Session 3
After the fight we find a piece of small green cloth from the large gladiator. It is the seal that was on his chest.
It is a bucks head with a crown of thorns. After another day and half we arrive at Sleep Vale. We get some creepy vibes
and the feeling of being watched in this town. As we open the door in the town to the doctors shop a smell of death
comes pouring out. As we enter a zesty man behind a curtain welcomes us and ushers Farma behind the curtain. He seems
to be forgetting about Alera like his memory was tampered with. I find a log book of other villagers remembering people
specifically. We head to the town and get a room in the inn. Horus gets me high as we share a room. The other 4 that
slept alone share a nightmare. Farma sees a creature climbing the roof after waking up and noticing the window was 
unlocked. The next day Horus follows the footsteps and finds a path that leads into the forest. We find a tree where we
believe the monster is. We start scaling the tree, he jumps down and attacks us. The fight was hard. After he was
defeated we get our memories back. On our way back to town we hear a commotion and a bunch of people looking for their
kids. Then, from the top of the hill, we hear a shout; "I MEMBER"!
