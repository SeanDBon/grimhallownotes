# Grim Hollow Main Story
> The story following the main party session by session

---

## Session One
The party meets up at a tavern with a fireplace running. While at the bar we meet up with Valera.
She gives the party two missions, one to find her missing contact, and one to investigate the Weeping pox. 
When the party was done talking with Valera they head to bed and have a vivid dream of a beautiful lady.
The lady is reading tarot cards about the past and the future. At the end of the dream she transforms in a
hideous old lady. </br>

The next day the party heads to Stehlenwald to look for Valera's missing contact. As we enter the city we see wrote 
on the wall like graffiti.
> Wallow in the filth, all yee who would be absolved

That was written on the wall with human puss. As we head towards the center of the city, the water channels are 
combining, we see a large statue of a man where the water is heading. We are seeing more and more graffiti, 
even in different languages, as we head towards the center. We see another type of graffiti of a grazer. 
It says bellow it
> Praise be the Grazer

Horus recognizes some graffiti as messaging from a cult. The cult thinks disease is a good thing and filters the chosen.
The closer to the center we get there a large amounts of body's strewn around the streets. Now at the center of the town
we see a line of people that live in the town. Some look angry about being here, some have sad eyes slowly moving up the
line. We watch as the first person in line walk up to statue and grabbed, sometimes fighting, and then gets dunked into
the water 3 times. After we watch for a bit we decide this is not okay, and we have to intervene. We all take a long
shot at the cultist leader and then combat begins. We kill off the cultist mages and only have the big armored man left.
With all the cultists in the water around the statue, we see these tentacles rise up from out of the water. The 
tentacles all have beaks on the end. It is the **Grazer**! Things get a bit dim for the party but M.I.A. and Horus 
manage to take down the Grazer, while the rest of the party delt with the big man. Inside the gladiator they find a 
blight crystal. The grazer suddenly starts rapidly degrading.

We see a man beckoning at us from a window to the north. M.I.A. starts righting stuff down about the encounter before
heading over to the man.
